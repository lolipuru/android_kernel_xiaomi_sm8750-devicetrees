Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. HW FENCE

HW Fence implements Linux APIs to initialize, deinitialize, register-for-signal, and
overall manage the hw-fences, for hw-to-hw communcation between hw cores.

Required properties
- compatible: Must be "qcom,msm-hw-fence".
- qcom,ipcc-reg: Registers ranges for ipcc registers.
- qcom,hw-fence-table-entries: A u32 indicating number of entries for the hw-fence table
- qcom,hw-fence-queue-entries: A u32 indicating default number of entries for the Queues
- hw_fence@1: Carved-out memory-mapping region, to be used for mapping of global tables and queues
	     used by the hw-fence driver and fence controller running either in secondary vm or
	     on SOCCP.
Required properties on targets without SOCCP:
- hw_fence@0: Doorbell configuration to communicate with secondary vm through hypervisor.
Required properties on targets with SOCCP:
- soccp_controller: Phandle for the soccp controller.
- interrupts: Interrupt associated with APSS NS0 (to receive interrupts from SOCCP).
- interrupt-controller: Mark the device node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be one. The first cell is interrupt number.
- iommus: Specifies the SID's used by this context bank.

Optional properties:
- qcom,hw-fence-ipc-ver: A u32 indicating ipc version. If not provided in device-tree, this is read
                       from the registers.
- qcom,hw-fence-client-type-[name]: A list of four u32 indicating <clients_num, queues_num,
				  queue_entries, skip_txq_wr_idx>, where [name] specifies the client
				  type these properties apply to. If provided, all four u32 values
				  must be provided, and these override default values specified by
				  the driver for some clients (e.g. dpu, gpu).
				  -- clients_num: number of clients for given client type
				  -- queues_num: 1 queue (TxQ) or 2 queues (RxQ and TxQ)
				  -- queue_entries: number of entries per client queue
				  -- skip_txq_wr_idx: bool indicating whether tx queue wr_idx update
						    is skipped within hw fence driver and
						    hfi_header->tx_wm is used instead
- qcom,hw-fence-client-type-[name]-extra: A list of four u32 indicating extra client queue
                                        properties: <start_padding, end_padding, txq_idx_start,
					txq_idx_by_payload>. Later u32 values do not need to be
					provided to provide values for earlier u32 values.
				        -- start_padding: size of padding between queue table header
					                and first queue header in bytes
				        -- end_padding: size of padding between queue header(s) and
						      first queue payload in bytes
					-- txq_idx_start: start_index for TxQ rd_wr_index
					-- txq_idx_by_payload: bool indicating whether TxQ rd_wr_idx
							     indexes by payloads instead of default
							     dwords
