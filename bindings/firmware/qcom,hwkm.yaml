description: |
  The HWKM driver is a platform device driver that helps
  communicating with both the master and slave blocks of the
  hardware key manager to issue commands to perform key operations
  mainly required for storage encryption.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: "qcom,hwkm"

  reg:
    description: |
      Register set for both master and slaves.

  reg-names:
    description: |
      Identifiers for parsing master and slave regs.

  clocks:
    description: |
      clocks needed for operating master and the slave.

  clock-names:
    description: |
      name identifiers corresponding to the clocks.
      qcom,enable-hwkm-clk: to ensure clocks can be handled by HLOS.
      qcom,op-freq-hz: Max frequency of the listed clocks.

required:
  - compatible
