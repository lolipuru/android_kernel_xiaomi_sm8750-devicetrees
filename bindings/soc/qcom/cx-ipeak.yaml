description:
  Cx ipeak HW module is used to limit the current drawn by various subsystem
  blocks on Cx power rail. Each client needs to set their bit in tcsr register
  if it is going to cross its own threshold. If all clients are going to cross
  their thresholds then Cx ipeak hw module will raise an interrupt to cDSP block
  to throttle cDSP's fmax.
